# Dijsktra algorithm

The project contains a simple implementation of Dijkstra's link state algorithm for fictional nodes. 

The goal was to aid in course exercises (more specifically to check my answers), where only smaller 'networks' are used as examples, and therefore the efficiency of the implementation hasn't been considered.
